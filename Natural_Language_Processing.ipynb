    "You'll be applying your models to the text from the Federalist Papers.  The Federalist papers were a series of essay written in 1787 and 1788 by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay (they were published anonymously at the time), that promoted the ratification of the U.S. Constitution.  If you're curious, you can read more about them here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers . They are a particularly interesting data set, because although the authorship of most of the essays has been long known since around the deaths of Hamilton and Madison, there was still some question about the authorship of certain articles into the 20th century.  You'll use document vectors and language models to do this analysis for yourself."

    "First, implement the `__init__()` function in the `LanguageModel` class.  You can store the information any way you want, but we did this by building a two-level dictionary (in fact, we used the `collections.defaultdict` class, but this only make a few things a little bit shorter ... you are free to use it or not) `self.counts`, where the first key refers to the previous $n-1$ tokens, and the second key refers to the $n$th token, and the value simply stores the count of the number of times this combination was seen.  For ease of use in later function, we also created a `self.count_sums`, which contained the number of total times each $n-1$ combination was seen. We also build a `self.dictionary` variable, which is just a `set` object containing all the unique words in across the entire set of input document."
